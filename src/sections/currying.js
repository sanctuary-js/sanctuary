//.
//. Sanctuary functions are curried. There is, for example, exactly one way to
//. apply `S.reduce` to `S.add`, `0`, and `xs`:
//.
//.   - `S.reduce (S.add) (0) (xs)`
//.
//. Ramda functions are also curried, but in a complex manner. There are four
//. ways to apply `R.reduce` to `R.add`, `0`, and `xs`:
//.
//.   - `R.reduce (R.add) (0) (xs)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.add) (0, xs)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.add, 0) (xs)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.add, 0, xs)`
//.
//. Ramda supports all these forms because curried functions enable partial
//. application, one of the library's tenets, but `f(x)(y)(z)` is considered
//. too unfamiliar and too unattractive to appeal to JavaScript programmers.
//.
//. Sanctuary's developers prefer a simple, unfamiliar construct to a complex,
//. familiar one. Familiarity can be acquired; complexity is intrinsic.
//.
//. The lack of breathing room in `f(x)(y)(z)` impairs readability. The simple
//. solution to this problem, proposed in [#438][], is to include a space when
//. applying a function: `f (x) (y) (z)`.
//.
//. Ramda also provides a special placeholder value, [`R.__`][], that removes
//. the restriction that a function must be applied to its arguments in order.
//. The following expressions are equivalent:
//.
//.   - `R.reduce (R.__, 0, xs) (R.add)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.add, R.__, xs) (0)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.__, 0) (R.add) (xs)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.__, 0) (R.add, xs)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.__, R.__, xs) (R.add) (0)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.__, R.__, xs) (R.add, 0)`
