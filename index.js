//. [![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/sanctuary-js/sanctuary/main.svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/sanctuary-js/sanctuary?branch=main)
//. [![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/badges/shields.svg)](https://gitter.im/sanctuary-js/sanctuary)
//.
//. Sanctuary is a JavaScript functional programming library inspired by
//. [Haskell][] and [PureScript][]. It's stricter than [Ramda][], and
//. provides a similar suite of functions.
//.
//. Sanctuary promotes programs composed of simple, pure functions. Such
//. programs are easier to comprehend, test, and maintain &ndash; they are
//. also a pleasure to write.
//.
//. Sanctuary provides two data types, [Maybe][] and [Either][], both of
//. which are compatible with [Fantasy Land][]. Thanks to these data types
//. even Sanctuary functions that may fail, such as [`head`](#head), are
//. composable.
//.
//. Sanctuary makes it possible to write safe code without null checks.
//. In JavaScript it's trivial to introduce a possible run-time type error:
//.
//.     words[0].toUpperCase()
//.
//. If `words` is `[]` we'll get a familiar error at run-time:
//.
//.     TypeError: Cannot read property 'toUpperCase' of undefined
//.
//. Sanctuary gives us a fighting chance of avoiding such errors. We might
//. write:
//.
//.     S.map (S.toUpper) (S.head (words))
//.
//. Sanctuary is designed to work in Node.js and in ES5-compatible browsers.
//.
//. ## Folktale
//.
//. [Folktale][], like Sanctuary, is a standard library for functional
//. programming in JavaScript. It is well designed and well documented.
//. Whereas Sanctuary treats JavaScript as a member of the ML language
//. family, Folktale embraces JavaScript's object-oriented programming
//. model. Programming with Folktale resembles programming with Scala.
//.
//. ## Ramda
//.
//. [Ramda][] provides several functions that return problematic values
//. such as `undefined`, `Infinity`, or `NaN` when applied to unsuitable
//. inputs. These are known as [partial functions][]. Partial functions
//. necessitate the use of guards or null checks. In order to safely use
//. `R.head`, for example, one must ensure that the array is non-empty:
//.
//.     if (R.isEmpty (xs)) {
//.       // ...
//.     } else {
//.       return f (R.head (xs));
//.     }
//.
//. Using the Maybe type renders such guards (and null checks) unnecessary.
//. Changing functions such as `R.head` to return Maybe values was proposed
//. in [ramda/ramda#683][], but was considered too much of a stretch for
//. JavaScript programmers. Sanctuary was released the following month,
//. in January 2015, as a companion library to Ramda.
//.
//. In addition to broadening in scope in the years since its release,
//. Sanctuary's philosophy has diverged from Ramda's in several respects.
//.
//. ### Totality
//.
//. Every Sanctuary function is defined for every value that is a member of
//. the function's input type. Such functions are known as [total functions][].
//. Ramda, on the other hand, contains a number of [partial functions][].
//.
//. ### Information preservation
//.
//. Certain Sanctuary functions preserve more information than their Ramda
//. counterparts. Examples:
//.
//.     |> R.tail ([])                      |> S.tail ([])
//.     []                                  Nothing
//.
//.     |> R.tail (['foo'])                 |> S.tail (['foo'])
//.     []                                  Just ([])
//.
//.     |> R.replace (/^x/) ('') ('abc')    |> S.stripPrefix ('x') ('abc')
//.     'abc'                               Nothing
//.
//.     |> R.replace (/^x/) ('') ('xabc')   |> S.stripPrefix ('x') ('xabc')
//.     'abc'                               Just ('abc')
//.
//. ### Invariants
//.
//. Sanctuary performs rigorous [type checking][] of inputs and outputs, and
//. throws a descriptive error if a type error is encountered. This allows bugs
//. to be caught and fixed early in the development cycle.
//.
//. Ramda operates on the [garbage in, garbage out][GIGO] principle. Functions
//. are documented to take arguments of particular types, but these invariants
//. are not enforced. The problem with this approach in a language as
//. permissive as JavaScript is that there's no guarantee that garbage input
//. will produce garbage output ([ramda/ramda#1413][]). Ramda performs ad hoc
//. type checking in some such cases ([ramda/ramda#1419][]).
//.
//. Sanctuary can be configured to operate in garbage in, garbage out mode.
//. Ramda cannot be configured to enforce its invariants.
//.
//. ### Currying
//.
//. Sanctuary functions are curried. There is, for example, exactly one way to
//. apply `S.reduce` to `S.add`, `0`, and `xs`:
//.
//.   - `S.reduce (S.add) (0) (xs)`
//.
//. Ramda functions are also curried, but in a complex manner. There are four
//. ways to apply `R.reduce` to `R.add`, `0`, and `xs`:
//.
//.   - `R.reduce (R.add) (0) (xs)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.add) (0, xs)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.add, 0) (xs)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.add, 0, xs)`
//.
//. Ramda supports all these forms because curried functions enable partial
//. application, one of the library's tenets, but `f(x)(y)(z)` is considered
//. too unfamiliar and too unattractive to appeal to JavaScript programmers.
//.
//. Sanctuary's developers prefer a simple, unfamiliar construct to a complex,
//. familiar one. Familiarity can be acquired; complexity is intrinsic.
//.
//. The lack of breathing room in `f(x)(y)(z)` impairs readability. The simple
//. solution to this problem, proposed in [#438][], is to include a space when
//. applying a function: `f (x) (y) (z)`.
//.
//. Ramda also provides a special placeholder value, [`R.__`][], that removes
//. the restriction that a function must be applied to its arguments in order.
//. The following expressions are equivalent:
//.
//.   - `R.reduce (R.__, 0, xs) (R.add)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.add, R.__, xs) (0)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.__, 0) (R.add) (xs)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.__, 0) (R.add, xs)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.__, R.__, xs) (R.add) (0)`
//.   - `R.reduce (R.__, R.__, xs) (R.add, 0)`
//.
//. ### Variadic functions
//.
//. Ramda provides several functions that take any number of arguments. These
//. are known as [variadic functions][]. Additionally, Ramda provides several
//. functions that take variadic functions as arguments. Although natural in
//. a dynamically typed language, variadic functions are at odds with the type
//. notation Ramda and Sanctuary both use, leading to some indecipherable type
//. signatures such as this one:
//.
//.     R.lift :: (*... -> *...) -> ([*]... -> [*])
//.
//. Sanctuary has no variadic functions, nor any functions that take variadic
//. functions as arguments. Sanctuary provides two "lift" functions, each with
//. a helpful type signature:
//.
//.     S.lift2 :: Apply f => (a -> b -> c) -> f a -> f b -> f c
//.     S.lift3 :: Apply f => (a -> b -> c -> d) -> f a -> f b -> f c -> f d
//.
//. ### Implicit context
//.
//. Ramda provides [`R.bind`][] and [`R.invoker`][] for working with methods.
//. Additionally, many Ramda functions use `Function#call` or `Function#apply`
//. to preserve context. Sanctuary makes no allowances for `this`.
//.
//. ### Transducers
//.
//. Several Ramda functions act as transducers. Sanctuary provides no support
//. for transducers.
//.
//. ### Modularity
//.
//. Whereas Ramda has no dependencies, Sanctuary has a modular design:
//. [sanctuary-def][] provides type checking, [sanctuary-type-classes][]
//. provides Fantasy Land functions and type classes, [sanctuary-show][]
//. provides string representations, and algebraic data types are provided
//. by [sanctuary-either][], [sanctuary-maybe][], and [sanctuary-pair][].
//. Not only does this approach reduce the complexity of Sanctuary itself,
//. but it allows these components to be reused in other contexts.
//.
//. ## Types
//.
//. Sanctuary uses Haskell-like type signatures to describe the types of
//. values, including functions. `'foo'`, for example, is a member of `String`;
//. `[1, 2, 3]` is a member of `Array Number`. The double colon (`::`) is used
//. to mean "is a member of", so one could write:
//.
//.     'foo' :: String
//.     [1, 2, 3] :: Array Number
//.
//. An identifier may appear to the left of the double colon:
//.
//.     Math.PI :: Number
//.
//. The arrow (`->`) is used to express a function's type:
//.
//.     Math.abs :: Number -> Number
//.
//. That states that `Math.abs` is a unary function that takes an argument
//. of type `Number` and returns a value of type `Number`.
//.
//. Some functions are parametrically polymorphic: their types are not fixed.
//. Type variables are used in the representations of such functions:
//.
//.     S.I :: a -> a
//.
//. `a` is a type variable. Type variables are not capitalized, so they
//. are differentiable from type identifiers (which are always capitalized).
//. By convention type variables have single-character names. The signature
//. above states that `S.I` takes a value of any type and returns a value of
//. the same type. Some signatures feature multiple type variables:
//.
//.     S.K :: a -> b -> a
//.
//. It must be possible to replace all occurrences of `a` with a concrete type.
//. The same applies for each other type variable. For the function above, the
//. types with which `a` and `b` are replaced may be different, but needn't be.
//.
//. Since all Sanctuary functions are curried (they accept their arguments
//. one at a time), a binary function is represented as a unary function that
//. returns a unary function: `* -> * -> *`. This aligns neatly with Haskell,
//. which uses curried functions exclusively. In JavaScript, though, we may
//. wish to represent the types of functions with arities less than or greater
//. than one. The general form is `(<input-types>) -> <output-type>`, where
//. `<input-types>` comprises zero or more comma–space (<code>, </code>)
//. -separated type representations:
//.
//.   - `() -> String`
//.   - `(a, b) -> a`
//.   - `(a, b, c) -> d`
//.
//. `Number -> Number` can thus be seen as shorthand for `(Number) -> Number`.
//.
//. Sanctuary embraces types. JavaScript doesn't support algebraic data types,
//. but these can be simulated by providing a group of data constructors that
//. return values with the same set of methods. A value of the Either type, for
//. example, is created via the Left constructor or the Right constructor.
//.
//. It's necessary to extend Haskell's notation to describe implicit arguments
//. to the *methods* provided by Sanctuary's types. In `x.map(y)`, for example,
//. the `map` method takes an implicit argument `x` in addition to the explicit
//. argument `y`. The type of the value upon which a method is invoked appears
//. at the beginning of the signature, separated from the arguments and return
//. value by a squiggly arrow (`~>`). The type of the `fantasy-land/map` method
//. of the Maybe type is written `Maybe a ~> (a -> b) -> Maybe b`. One could
//. read this as:
//.
//. _When the `fantasy-land/map` method is invoked on a value of type `Maybe a`
//. (for any type `a`) with an argument of type `a -> b` (for any type `b`),
//. it returns a value of type `Maybe b`._
//.
//. The squiggly arrow is also used when representing non-function properties.
//. `Maybe a ~> Boolean`, for example, represents a Boolean property of a value
//. of type `Maybe a`.
//.
//. Sanctuary supports type classes: constraints on type variables. Whereas
//. `a -> a` implicitly supports every type, `Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a ->
//. f b` requires that `f` be a type that satisfies the requirements of the
//. Functor type class. Type-class constraints appear at the beginning of a
//. type signature, separated from the rest of the signature by a fat arrow
//. (`=>`).
//.
//. ## Type checking
//.
//. Sanctuary functions are defined via [sanctuary-def][] to provide run-time
//. type checking. This is tremendously useful during development: type errors
//. are reported immediately, avoiding circuitous stack traces (at best) and
//. silent failures due to type coercion (at worst). For example:
//.
//. ```javascript
//. S.add (2) (true);
//. // ! TypeError: Invalid value
//. //
//. //   add :: FiniteNumber -> FiniteNumber -> FiniteNumber
//. //                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^
//. //                               1
//. //
//. //   1)  true :: Boolean
//. //
//. //   The value at position 1 is not a member of ‘FiniteNumber’.
//. //
//. //   See v:sanctuary-js/sanctuary-def#FiniteNumber for information about the FiniteNumber type.
//. ```
//.
//. Compare this to the behaviour of Ramda's unchecked equivalent:
//.
//. ```javascript
//. R.add (2) (true);
//. // => 3
//. ```
//.
//. There is a performance cost to run-time type checking. Type checking is
//. disabled by default if `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `'production'`. If this
//. rule is unsuitable for a given program, one may use [`create`](#create)
//. to create a Sanctuary module based on a different rule. For example:
//.
//. ```javascript
//. const S = sanctuary.create ({
//.   checkTypes: localStorage.getItem ('SANCTUARY_CHECK_TYPES') === 'true',
//.   env: sanctuary.env,
//. });
//. ```
//.
//. Occasionally one may wish to perform an operation that is not type safe,
//. such as mapping over an object with heterogeneous values. This is possible
//. via selective use of [`unchecked`](#unchecked) functions.
//.
//. ## Installation
//.
//. `npm install sanctuary` will install Sanctuary for use in Node.js.
//.
//. To add Sanctuary to a website, add the following `<script>` element,
//. replacing `X.Y.Z` with a version number greater than or equal to `2.0.2`:
//.
//. ```html
//. <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sanctuary-js/sanctuary@X.Y.Z/dist/bundle.js"></script>
//. ```
//.
//. Optionally, define aliases for various modules:
//.
//. ```javascript
//. const S = window.sanctuary;
//. const $ = window.sanctuaryDef;
//. // ...
//. ```
//.
//. ## API

  //. ### Configure

  //# create :: { checkTypes :: Boolean, env :: Array Type } -> Module
  //.
  //. Takes an options record and returns a Sanctuary module. `checkTypes`
  //. specifies whether to enable type checking. The module's polymorphic
  //. functions (such as [`I`](#I)) require each value associated with a
  //. type variable to be a member of at least one type in the environment.
  //.
  //. A well-typed application of a Sanctuary function will produce the same
  //. result regardless of whether type checking is enabled. If type checking
  //. is enabled, a badly typed application will produce an exception with a
  //. descriptive error message.
  //.
  //. The following snippet demonstrates defining a custom type and using
  //. `create` to produce a Sanctuary module that is aware of that type:
  //.
  //. ```javascript
  //. const {create, env} = require ('sanctuary');
  //. const $ = require ('sanctuary-def');
  //. const type = require ('sanctuary-type-identifiers');
  //.
  //. //    Identity :: a -> Identity a
  //. const Identity = x => {
  //.   const identity = Object.create (Identity$prototype);
  //.   identity.value = x;
  //.   return identity;
  //. };
  //.
  //. //    identityTypeIdent :: String
  //. const identityTypeIdent = 'my-package/Identity@1';
  //.
  //. const Identity$prototype = {
  //.   '@@type': identityTypeIdent,
  //.   '@@show': function() { return `Identity (${S.show (this.value)})`; },
  //.   'fantasy-land/map': function(f) { return Identity (f (this.value)); },
  //. };
  //.
  //. //    IdentityType :: Type -> Type
  //. const IdentityType = $.UnaryType
  //.   ('Identity')
  //.   ('http://example.com/my-package#Identity')
  //.   ([])
  //.   (x => type (x) === identityTypeIdent)
  //.   (identity => [identity.value]);
  //.
  //. const S = create ({
  //.   checkTypes: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
  //.   env: env.concat ([IdentityType ($.Unknown)]),
  //. });
  //.
  //. S.map (S.sub (1)) (Identity (43));
  //. // => Identity (42)
  //. ```
  //.
  //. See also [`env`](#env).
  const create = ({checkTypes, env}) => {
    const def = $.create ({checkTypes, env});
    const S = {};
    for (const [name, {consts, types, impl}] of Object.entries (_)) {
      S[name] = def (name) (consts) (types) (impl);
    }
    S.env = env;
    S.is = def ('is') ({}) ([$.Type, $.Any, $.Boolean]) ($.test (env));
    S.Maybe = Maybe;
    S.Nothing = Nothing;
    S.Either = Either;
    S.unchecked = checkTypes ? create ({checkTypes: false, env}) : S;
    return S;
  };
  _.create = {
    consts: {},
    types: [Options, $.Object],
    impl: create,
  };

  //# env :: Array Type
  //.
  //. The Sanctuary module's environment (`(S.create ({checkTypes, env})).env`
  //. is a reference to `env`). Useful in conjunction with [`create`](#create).
  //.
  //. ```javascript
  //. > S.env
  //. [ $.AnyFunction,
  //. . $.Arguments,
  //. . $.Array ($.Unknown),
  //. . $.Array2 ($.Unknown) ($.Unknown),
  //. . $.Boolean,
  //. . $.Buffer,
  //. . $.Date,
  //. . $.Descending ($.Unknown),
  //. . $.Either ($.Unknown) ($.Unknown),
  //. . $.Error,
  //. . $.Fn ($.Unknown) ($.Unknown),
  //. . $.HtmlElement,
  //. . $.Identity ($.Unknown),
  //. . $.JsMap ($.Unknown) ($.Unknown),
  //. . $.JsSet ($.Unknown),
  //. . $.Maybe ($.Unknown),
  //. . $.Module,
  //. . $.Null,
  //. . $.Number,
  //. . $.Object,
  //. . $.Pair ($.Unknown) ($.Unknown),
  //. . $.RegExp,
  //. . $.StrMap ($.Unknown),
  //. . $.String,
  //. . $.Symbol,
  //. . $.Type,
  //. . $.TypeClass,
  //. . $.Undefined ]
  //. ```

  //# unchecked :: Module
  //.
  //. A complete Sanctuary module that performs no type checking. This is
  //. useful as it permits operations that Sanctuary's type checking would
  //. disallow, such as mapping over an object with heterogeneous values.
  //.
  //. See also [`create`](#create).
  //.
  //. ```javascript
  //. > S.unchecked.map (S.show) ({x: 'foo', y: true, z: 42})
  //. {x: '"foo"', y: 'true', z: '42'}
  //. ```
  //.
  //. Opting out of type checking may cause type errors to go unnoticed.
  //.
  //. ```javascript
  //. > S.unchecked.add (2) ('2')
  //. '22'
  //. ```

  //. ### Classify

  //# type :: Any -> { namespace :: Maybe String, name :: String, version :: NonNegativeInteger }
  //.
  //. Returns the result of parsing the [type identifier][] of the given value.
  //.
  //. ```javascript
  //. > S.type (S.Just (42))
  //. {namespace: Just ('sanctuary-maybe'), name: 'Maybe', version: 1}

  //. [type identifier][] is `'Object'` and the values of its enumerable own
  //. properties are all members of type `a`.

  //# value :: String -> StrMap a -> Maybe a
  //.
  //. Retrieve the value associated with the given key in the given string map.
  //.
  //. Formally, `value (k) (m)` evaluates to `Just (m[k])` if `k` is an
  //. enumerable own property of `m`; `Nothing` otherwise.
  //.
  //. See also [`prop`](#prop) and [`get`](#get).
  //.
  //. ```javascript
